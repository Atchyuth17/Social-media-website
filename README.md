1. My project is all about posting the content paragraphs  or anything where users can easily make contact with other users and chat and share their posts 

2. And there are no bugs in the project but due to limited resources and everything added only 8 names where they could be friends with each other and there are some exception handling that may occur during the execution 

3. And used all the technology which I could 
For the front end:  angular and node.js
for the back end: I used my PostgreSQL aka Dbeaver and node.js  

4. Screenshots of all the ERD diagrams from the front end to the back end whole project 

I am attching the screenshots file so it is better to see in that way 

5.
If someone downloads my project needs to  use it using the server and these commands 

They should install angular 
Node .js 
And postgre MySQL 

front end we use npm install -g@angular/cli 
Back end we use Npm init -y 

commands for connecting to the server for both the front end and back end is npm install after that try to start it using the npm start 


6. And all the functionality of the project from top to bottom 

A user needs to sign up if he is nee user and should remember both username and password

Using that they need to log in 

And there is page appears which contains 
Posts: you could see all the posts 

and chat 
send messages: you could send the messages to the friends 
 create a post: you could add a summary of anything with a title and post it 

And there is a logout option
